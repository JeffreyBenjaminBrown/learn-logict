This Git repository contains two things:
  a copy of the Darcs repository for the LogicT monad transformer
  a folder called introduction/.

The LogicT monad is "[a]n adaptation of the two-continuation implementation found in the paper [Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers](http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/LogicT.pdf). 

The file `introduction/adapting-paper-to-logict.hs` contains my adaptation of the code in that paper to run in the LogicT monad, with explanatory comments.

The folder `introduction/for-paper,by-its-authors/` contains the code they wrote for the paper. I haven't worked through it, but I did refer to it a few times when my own adaptations weren't working.
